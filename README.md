# seriald

seriald is a high performance deamon which manage a serial port as well as provides the OpenWrt ubus interface for IPC. The binary size is only 21 kB.

## Usage

### Run daemon

```
seriald /dev/ttyS0
```

Can run multiple daemons on different device nodes.

#### Options

See

```
seriald -h
```

### Read from serial port

Command:

```
ubus listen serial.ttyS0
```

Result:

```
{ "serial.ttyS0": {"data":"<incoming message>"} }
```

`<incoming message>` is a line read from the serial port. All the `CR` (`\r`) and `LF` (`\n`) characters will be eliminated from it.

### Write to serial port

```
ubus call serial.ttyS0 send '{"data": "<outgoing message>"}'
```

`data` is a fixed attribute. To send a message to the serial port, replace `<outgoing message>` with the message you want to send.
An `<outgoing message>` will be appended an `LF` (`\n`) character at the end before seriald passes it to the serial port.
